## Sub-1: Unsupervised, clustering

In this assignment, clustering was used to identify different groups of customers who may be of interest to the bank for the implementation of loyalty card programs. This was carried out by analyzing the "marketing_campaign.csv" dataset with unsupervised machine learning methods, aimed at identifying distinct groups within the dataset that could be of strategic importance to the bank. The specific steps and methods used in this process are extensively documented in the file.

## Sub-2: Supervised learning

In this assignment, supervised learning methods were employed to predict car sales prices based on features such as color, year, odometer reading, and condition. This was aimed at assisting a car salesman in making informed pricing decisions. The dataset analyzed was the "used car auction prices dataset," and the analysis involved comparing the performance of various models: Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XGBoost, and Linear Regression.

The investigation focused on several sub-questions to explore the impact of features on model accuracy, the optimal hyperparameter settings for each model, the robustness of the models in price prediction, and a comparison of their predictive performances. The methods and steps undertaken in this analysis are thoroughly documented, covering aspects from data cleaning and feature engineering to model fitting and evaluation, utilizing techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and validation strategies to assess model performance.

Overall, the project aimed to identify the most effective machine learning model for predicting car sales prices based on auction data, providing valuable insights for making pricing decisions.
